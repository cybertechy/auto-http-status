## Key Test Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **All 5 layers** tested individually and in integration
- **Error scenarios** extensively covered
- **Edge cases** like null/undefined inputs, malformed data
- **Performance testing** with rapid calls and memory leak prevention

### Mock Implementation
- **LLM API calls** mocked with realistic responses
- **Environment variables** properly isolated between tests
- **Error injection** for testing failure scenarios

### Real-world Scenarios
- **Express.js integration** examples
- **Complex error objects** with mixed properties
- **Various HTTP methods** and request contexts
- **Network failures** and API timeouts

## Quality Metrics

- **High test coverage**: 98.43% branch coverage with only 1 uncovered line
- **Fast execution**: All tests complete in ~3.5 seconds
- **Reliable**: Tests are deterministic and don't depend on external services
- **Maintainable**: Tests are well-organized and use consistent patterns

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

This comprehensive test suite ensures the library is reliable, handles edge cases gracefully, and maintains high quality standards.
